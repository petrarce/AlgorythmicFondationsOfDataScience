\subsection*{a}
$\implies$ direction: Suppose 
$\exists B: A = B B^T$ and 
$\exists (\lambda, u) - \text{eigen-pair of A}$.\\ 
Then 
$Au = \lambda  u = BB^Tu (\text{multiply both sides by $u^T$})\implies u^TBB^Tu = u^T\lambda u, (B^Tu)^T B^Tu = \lambda <u,u> = \lambda ||u||^2 = ||B^Tu||^2 \implies \lambda = \dfrac {||B^Tu||^2}{||u||^2} \geq 0$ 
- thus all eigenvalues of A nonnegative, which means that A is psd.\\
$\impliedby$ direction: Suppose A is psd. Then there exists Cholesky decomposition of A: $A = LL^T$, where L is lover triangular matrices, which implies, that for psd A $\exists B = L, s.t. A = BB^T$
\subsection*{b}
Suppose we have matrix $A = $ 
$\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\
b & c
\end{pmatrix}$
Then to find eigenvalues we have to find roots of $det(A - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - (a+c)\lambda + a\cdot c - b^2$.
Suppose $a = 1 \text{ and } c = 1$, then $\lambda = \pm b + 1$. This means, that $\forall b > 1$ matrix $A = $
$\begin{pmatrix}
1 & b\\
b & 1
\end{pmatrix}$
 is not psd, while one of the eigenvalues is $\lambda = -b + 1 < 0$.
