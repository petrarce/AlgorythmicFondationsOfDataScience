Given any symmetric probability matrix Q suppose, that $\forall i,j = [n]: \pi_i = \pi_j = \dfrac{1}{n}$. 
Then $\forall i,j = [n]: \pi_i \cdot q_{i,j} = \pi_j \cdot q_{j,i}$,
where $q_{i,j} = q_{j,i}$ since Q is symmetric and $\pi_i = \pi_j$ by definition.
Consequently by theorem 6.4, uniform distribution $\pi$ is a stationary distribution for matrix Q.
Thus for any symmetric probability matrix Q, defined $\pi$ is a stationary distribution.
