\textbf{(a)}\\
 V(H)= All independent sets of graph \\
E(H)= Edge of H is $(I,I_{v})$ such that for all v $\in $V(G)  \\
\[
  I_{v} =
  \begin{cases}
                                   I \cup \{v\} & \text{if v is independent of I} \\
                                   I \cup \{v\} \backslash \{w\} & \text{if (v,w) $\in$ E(G) and V is independent of  I \textbackslash \{w\}} \\
  				I \backslash \{v\}  & \text{if v $\in I_{i}$ }\\
				undefined 
  \end{cases}
\]



\textbf{(b)}\\ Since maximum number of additions and substraction of vertices is bounded by $|V(G)|$ 
and number of transitions from empty set is exactly $|V(G)|$  then $\Delta = n = \mid V(G) \mid $. 
Since $\emptyset \in \mathbb{I}_{G}$, and 
$\forall I \in \mathbb{I}_G : \emptyset \text{ can by reached form $I$ by deleting all nodes, thus $H$ is connected}$. \\

\textbf(c)\\
Taking that $\forall I\in \mathbb{I}_G: D(I) = 1$, according to Metropolis-Hastings, probability distributions will look this way: \\
\[
 q_{I,\hat{I}} =
  \begin{cases}
                                   \dfrac{1}{n} & \text{if $I \neq \hat{I}$} \\
                                   \dfrac{(n- \mid N_{H}(I)\mid)} {n} & \text{if $I = \hat{I}$} \\
  			0  & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\]
