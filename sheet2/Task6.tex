Given is a random multiplicative weight update problem with 3 experts and 4 events. The event set is defined as $j^{(t)}$=121234 and the loss matrix L=$ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0.5\\
\end{bmatrix}
$.\\
Final result:

According to the probabilistic MWU algorithm the weights are changed according to the formula $W_i^k = W_i^{k-1} \cdot (1 - \alpha)^{L_{i,j^{(k)}}} = W_i^0 \cdot (1-\alpha)^{\sum_{t=0}^k L_{i,j^{(t)}}}$. Depending on the order of $j^{(t)}$ order of the components of this sum $\sum_{t=0}^k L_{i,j^{(t)}}$ will change, but not the final value, thus the final weight values will always stay the same depending on the order of events (assuming that we have the same events). But weights of the intermediate rounds could change. E.g. calculations for events list 432121:
