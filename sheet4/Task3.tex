In this case Power Iteration doesn't converge to solution. Using characteristic equation we can find exact solution for eigenvalues. 
\begin{equation}
	det(M_3 - \lambda I) = ... = (\lambda - 2)^2 \cdot (\lambda + 2)
\end{equation}
Thus there are 2 eigenvalues for $M_3$: $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = -2$, which means, that assumption 5.24 is violated ($\not \exists \lambda_1: \lambda_1 > |\lambda_2|$).

The exact solution for $M_3^{-1} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	-2.5 & 6\\
	-0.5 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$ we can find using characteristic equation: $det(M_3^{-1} - \lambda I) = (\lambda + 1)\cdot (\lambda + 0.5)$.
the eigenvalue with smallest absolute value for $M_3: \lambda = -1$. The corresponding eigenvector can be computed by solving SLE:
\begin{equation}
		(M_3^{-1} - (-1)\cdot I)u = 
		\begin{pmatrix}
			-1.5 & 6\\
			-0.5 & 2
		\end{pmatrix}
		u = 0
\end{equation}
Taking $u_x = 1$, $u_y = 0.25\cdot u_x = 0.25$.
